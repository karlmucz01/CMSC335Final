## App Description
My app was made to be as simple as possible but still satisfying all the requirements. 
The first section is a login page where you can sign up to create a user to login with later. If you try to login as a user without a valid sign up you will be unable to login successfully.
The second section of the app uses the wordsAPI to get definitions of words and it lists all the definitions as well as the part of speech for the respective definition of the word.
